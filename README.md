# PROVISIONAL_NAME

We want to build a 2d browser fighting game featuring unique 3D printed controllers for each character. The controllers will be powered by Arduino and connected by WiFi (or BLE) to the game. By using the bast ammount of sensors available, each controller will play out in different and unique ways, pushing the assimetry that makes fighting games so deep and brilliant to a maximum. 

For example, we can play with heartbeat sensors, wrapped around the player's wrist to control a passive element on the user. Distance sensors to have a new way to handle movement on one axis. IR to connect a split-in-two controller in various ways. The possibilities are endless.

With the apparition of 3D printing, making controllers with different shapes to accomodate these new ways to input information into the game is easier than ever. 



# Concept for Character using Òpla Kit as Controller

To quickstart development, we have designed a character around the Òpla Kit. This will allow us to get the first controller out of the box, to be able to start testing and playing while we design some more advanced (and 3D printed) controllers.
